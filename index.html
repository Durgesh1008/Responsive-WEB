            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under <b>the guidance of educators</b>; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. <b>The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy</b>.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small"><strong> began in prehistory</strong>, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, <b>formal education developed</b>. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, <b>established in 330 BCE</b>, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of
                literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle
                Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval
                universities and forebears of many of Europe's <b>modern universities</b>. During the High Middle Ages,
                Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval
                universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged
                freedom of inquiry, and <b>produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers</b>, including
                Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early
                expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a
                pioneer of biological field research.[11] Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the
                first, and the oldest continually operating university.</p>
